I have chosen to redact the database used in the classifier project due to copyright concerns,
however the classifier can still be applied to other NIST-Style databases easily

All code that hasn't been modified has been commented on and is the intellectual property of Amir-Atapour-Abarghouei.

Thanks to Mr. Abarghouei for providing an excellent skeleton to build this project upon, I highly recommend reading his work AI.
